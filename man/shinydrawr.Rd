\title{Gather recorded data from UI.}
\usage{
shinydrawr(input, output, session, data, draw_start, raw_draw = FALSE,
  draw_after = TRUE, x_key = "x", y_key = "y", y_min = NA, y_max = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{you can ignore this as it is taken care of by shiny}

\item{output}{you can ignore this as it is taken care of by shiny}

\item{session}{you can ignore this as it is taken care of by shiny}

\item{data}{dataframe containing data you want to plot in two of its columns}

\item{draw_start}{position on the x-axis the true data is blocked off and the user is to draw from.}

\item{raw_draw}{set to true if you want to not draw any line, just let the user draw everything. Auto sets draw_start to begining of data.}

\item{draw_after}{set to true of you want the true data drawn after all points are drawn by the user.}

\item{x_key}{name of the x column.}

\item{y_key}{name of the y column.}

\item{y_min}{value of the lowest possible value the user is allowed to draw, defaults to lowest seen in data.}

\item{y_max}{value of the highest possible value the user is allowed to draw, defaults to highest seen in data.}
}
\description{
Upon completion of line draw, returns a reactive variable that contains a vector of the y coordinates of what the user has drawn. This also includes the start point specified with `draw_start`
    This is the server component of shinydrawr. You never directly use this function but instead call it through the shiny function `callModule()`. See the example for how to do this.
