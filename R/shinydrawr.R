#' @param id the id you will use to keep track of this component in your app

#' @return A blue button that you press to initiate or stop recording of sound.

#' Gather recorded data from UI.

#' Upon completion of line draw, returns a reactive variable that contains a vector of the y coordinates of what the user has drawn. This also includes the start point specified with `draw_start`
#'     This is the server component of shinydrawr. You never directly use this function but instead call it through the shiny function `callModule()`. See the example for how to do this.

#' @param input you can ignore this as it is taken care of by shiny

#' @param session you can ignore this as it is taken care of by shiny
#' @param data dataframe containing data you want to plot in two of its columns
#' @param draw_start position on the x-axis the true data is blocked off and the user is to draw from.
#' @param raw_draw set to true if you want to not draw any line, just let the user draw everything. Auto sets draw_start to begining of data.
#' @param draw_after set to true of you want the true data drawn after all points are drawn by the user.
#' @param x_key name of the x column.
#' @param y_key name of the y column.
#' @param y_min value of the lowest possible value the user is allowed to draw, defaults to lowest seen in data.
